## Manifolds and its Structures

### Topological Manifolds

Let $M$ be a **Hausdorff** and **second countable** topological space that is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$. We say that $M$ is a **manifold of dimension $n$** if $\forall p \in M, \exists U \subseteq M,\exists \phi: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\phi$ is a homeomorphism onto its image and $\phi(U)$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Sometime we denote it as $M^n$.

We denote $(U,\phi)$ as a coordinate chart, $\phi$ as a coordinate map, and $\phi^{-1}$ as a parameterization of $U$.

### Atlas and $C^{k}$-structure

An **atlas** on a topological manifold $M$ is a collection of coordinate charts $\mathcal{A} = \{(U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in I}$ where $\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_\alpha = M$.

Let $(U,\phi)$ and $(V, \psi)$ be two coordinate charts in the atlas $\mathcal{A}$. The **transition map** from $(U, \phi)$ to $(V, \psi)$ is defined as $\psi \circ \phi^{-1}: \phi(U \cap V) \to \psi(U \cap V)$.

We call the transition map **$C^{k}$ compatible** if it is a $C^{k}$ function. And we say that the atlas $\mathcal{A}$ is a **$C^{k}$-atlas** if $\forall (U, \phi), (V, \psi) \in \mathcal{A}, U\cap V \neq \emptyset$, the transition map $\psi \circ \phi^{-1}\in C^{k}(\phi(U \cap V)\cap \psi(U \cap V))$.

We say $(U, \phi)$ are **$C^{k}$-compatible with $\mathcal{A}$** if it is $C^{k}$ compatible with every chart in $\mathcal{A}$.

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a $C^{k}$-atlas on a topological manifold $M$. Maximal extension of $\mathcal{A}$: $\overline{\mathcal{A}} = \{(U, \phi) : (U, \phi) \text{ is } C^{k} \text{-compatible with } \mathcal{A}\}$. It is unique by definition and is a $C^{k}$-atlas on $M$.

And it is not hard to prove that if $\overline{\mathcal{A}} = \overline{\mathcal{B}}$ for another $C^{k}$-atlas $\mathcal{B}$, then $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$ is also a $C^{k}$-atlas on $M$.

Actually, Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the collection of all $C^{k}$-compatible coordinate charts on $M$. Then $(\mathcal{F}, \subseteq)$ is a directed set. And $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ is the maximal element of $\mathcal{F}$.

We call $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ a maximal $C^{k}$-atlas or a **$C^{k}$-structure** on $M$. A manifold with a $C^{k}$-structure is called a **$C^{k}$-manifold**.

### Smooth Manifolds

A **smooth manifold** is a $C^{\infty}$-manifold.

### Coordinate Functions

Let $(U, \phi)$ be a coordinate chart on a $n$-manifold $M$. The **coordinate functions** are the components of the coordinate map $\phi: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$, denoted as $\phi = (\phi^1, \phi^2, \ldots, \phi^n)$. We call the coordinate functions $\phi^i: U \to \mathbb{R}$ the **$i$-th coordinate function**.

For $p\in U$, we write $\phi(p) = (x^1, x^2, \ldots, x^n)$, where $x^i = \phi^i(p)$.

And we call $(x^1, x^2, \ldots, x^n)$ the local coordinates of $p$ in the chart $(U, \phi)$.

### Tangent Vectors and Tangent Spaces

#### Germs of functions

A **germ of a function** at a point $p \in M$ is an equivalence class of functions defined on a neighborhood of $p$. Two functions $f$ and $g$ are equivalent if they agree on some neighborhood of $p$. 

Formally, let $(f,U)$ and $(g,V)$ be two functions defined on neighborhoods $U$ and $V$ of $p$. If there exists a neighborhood $W \subseteq U \cap V$ such that $f|_W = g|_W$, then we say that the germ of $f$ at $p$ is equal to the germ of $g$ at $p$, denoted as $(f,U) \sim (g,V)$.

A germ of a function at $p$ is denoted as $[f]_p$, $[f]$ or $f$ if the context is clear.

We denote $C^{\infty}_p(M)$ or $C^{\infty}_p$ as the set of germs of smooth functions at $p \in M$. Formally, $C^{\infty}_p(M) = \{ [f]_p : f \in C^{\infty}(U), U \text{ is a neighborhood of } p \}$. 

If we write $f \in C^{\infty}_p(M)$, it means that $[f]_p\in C^{\infty}_p(M)$.

#### Definition 

There is three common definitions of tangent vectors on a manifold $M$: 
1. **Tangent Vector as Derivation**: A tangent vector at a point $p \in M$ is a linear map $v: C^{\infty}_p(M) \to \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the Leibniz rule: $v(fg) = v(f)g(p) + f(p)v(g)$ for all $f, g \in C^{\infty}_p(M)$.
2. **Tangent Vector as Equivalence Class of Curves**: A tangent vector at a point $p \in M$ is an equivalence class of curves $\gamma: (-\epsilon, \epsilon) \to M$ such that $\gamma(0) = p$.
3. **Tangent Vector as Derivative of Coordinate Functions**: A tangent vector at a point $p \in M$ is a vector in the tangent space $T_pM$ defined as the set of all derivations at $p$ or equivalence classes of curves through $p$.

The **tangent space** at a point $p \in M$, denoted as $T_pM$, is the set of all tangent vectors at $p$. It is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ of dimension $n$, same as the dimension of the manifold $M$.

We shall mainly focus on the first definition of tangent vectors as derivations, which is the most general and abstract definition. 

The tangent space is equipped with a natural $\mathbb{R}$-vector space structure.

##### Coordinate Expression

Let $(U,x)=(U,x^1,\ldots,x^n)$ be a coordinate chart containing $p$. 

Consider $\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p: C^{\infty}_p(M)\to \mathbb{R}$ act on $f:U\to \mathbb R$ defined as $$\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p([f])=\left.\frac{\partial(f\circ x^{-1})}{\partial x^i}\right |_{x(p)}$$

We know that $\left \{\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{1}}\right|_p,\ldots,\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\right|_p\right \}$ forms a basis of $T_p M$, $\dim T_pM = \dim M=n $.

By definition, we can prove the Kronecker delta property:
$$ \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p(x^j) = \frac{\partial x^j\circ x^{-1}}{\partial x^i} \bigg|_{x(p)} = \delta^j_i $$
where $\delta^i_j$ is the Kronecker delta, which is $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ otherwise.

So every $X_p \in T_pM$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors: $X_p = \sum_{i=1}^n X_p^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p$, where $X_p^i =X_p(x^i)\in \mathbb{R}$.

The coordinate expression of a tangent vector $X_p$ at $p$ in the chart $(U,x)$ is given by the tuple $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$, where $a_i$ are the coefficients in the linear combination.

### Fiber Bundles

#### Definition of Fiber Bundle

A **fiber bundle** is a structure $(E, M, \pi, F)$ consisting of:

- **Total space**: $E$ (a manifold)
- **Base space**: $M$ (a manifold) 
- **Bundle projection**: $\pi: E \to M$ (a smooth surjective map)
- **Typical fiber**: $F$ (a manifold)

such that the **local triviality condition** holds: for each point $p \in M$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $p$ and a diffeomorphism $\phi: \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times F$ satisfying:
$$ \text{pr}_1 \circ \phi = \pi|_{\pi^{-1}(U)} $$
where $\text{pr}_1: U \times F \to U$ is the projection onto the first factor.

The pair $(U, \phi)$ is called a **local trivialization** or **bundle chart**.

For each $p \in M$, the **fiber** over $p$ is defined as $F_p = \pi^{-1}(p)$. The local triviality ensures that each fiber $F_p$ is diffeomorphic to the typical fiber $F$.

Intuitively, a fiber bundle describes a space that 'locally looks like a product' but may have global twisting, like the MÃ¶bius strip over a circle.

#### Vector Bundles

A **vector bundle** is a fiber bundle $(E, M, \pi, \mathbb{R}^k)$ where:

1. Each fiber $F_p = \pi^{-1}(p)$ has the structure of a $k$-dimensional real vector space.
2. The local trivializations $\phi: \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times \mathbb{R}^k$ are **linear** on each fiber, meaning that for each $p \in U$, the restriction $\phi|_{F_p}: F_p \to \{p\} \times \mathbb{R}^k \cong \mathbb{R}^k$ is a vector space isomorphism.

The integer $k$ is called the **rank** of the vector bundle.

### Tangent Bundle

The **tangent bundle** of a manifold $M$, denoted as $TM$, is the vector bundle whose total space is the disjoint union of all tangent spaces:
$$ TM = \bigcup_{p \in M} T_pM = \{(p, X_p) : p \in M, X_p \in T_pM\}$$

The **bundle projection** $\pi: TM \to M$ is defined by $\pi(p, X_p) = p$.

**Local Trivialization**: Let $(U, x = (x^1, \ldots, x^n))$ be a coordinate chart on $M$. The tangent bundle can be locally trivialized over $U$ by the map:
$$ \Phi: \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times \mathbb{R}^n $$
$$ \Phi(p, X_p) = \left(p, (X_p^1, \ldots, X_p^n)\right) $$
where $X_p = \sum_{i=1}^n X_p^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p$ is the coordinate representation of the tangent vector $X_p$.

**Manifold Structure**: The tangent bundle $TM$ is a smooth manifold of dimension $2n$, where $n$ is the dimension of $M$. The coordinate charts on $TM$ are given by $(U \times \mathbb{R}^n, \Phi^{-1})$ where $(U, x)$ ranges over all coordinate charts on $M$.

**Transition Maps**: If $(U, x)$ and $(V, y)$ are two overlapping coordinate charts on $M$, the transition map between the corresponding bundle charts is:
$$ \Phi_V \circ \Phi_U^{-1}: (U \cap V) \times \mathbb{R}^n \to (U \cap V) \times \mathbb{R}^n $$
$$ (p, (v^1, \ldots, v^n)) \mapsto \left(p, \left(\sum_{i=1}^n v^i \frac{\partial y^j}{\partial x^i}\bigg|_p\right)_{j=1}^n\right) $$

This map is smooth, confirming that $TM$ has a smooth manifold structure.

### Sections of Fiber Bundles

#### Definition of Sections

Let $\pi: E \to M$ be a fiber bundle projection. A **section** of $E$ is a map $s: M \to E$ such that $\pi \circ s = \text{id}_M$. In other words, for each point $p \in M$, we have $s(p) \in E_p$ (the fiber over $p$).

A section $s$ is called **smooth** if $s: M \to E$ is a smooth map between manifolds.

#### Local Expression of Smoothness

Let $(U, \phi)$ be a local trivialization of $E$ over an open set $U \subseteq M$, where $\phi: \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times F$ for some typical fiber $F$. Any section $s$ over $U$ can be written as:
$$ \phi \circ s|_U: U \to U \times F $$
which has the form $p \mapsto (p, f(p))$ for some function $f: U \to F$.

Sometimes we just say $f$ is a section of $E$ over $U$.

#### Space of Sections

We denote by $\Gamma(E)$ or $\Gamma(M, E)$ the space of all smooth sections of the fiber bundle $E \to M$.

**For General Fiber Bundles**: The space $\Gamma(E)$ has the structure of a set with pointwise operations (when they make sense on the typical fiber).

**For Vector Bundles**: When $E \to M$ is a vector bundle with typical fiber $\mathbb{R}^k$, the space $\Gamma(E)$ has additional algebraic structures:

1. **Vector space structure**: For sections $s_1, s_2 \in \Gamma(E)$ and scalars $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$:
   $ (as_1 + bs_2)(p) = as_1(p) + bs_2(p) \in E_p $

2. **$C^\infty(M)$-module structure**: For a smooth function $f \in C^\infty(M)$ and a section $s \in \Gamma(E)$:
   $ (fs)(p) = f(p) \cdot s(p) \in E_p $

These structures exist because each fiber $E_p$ is a vector space, allowing us to perform linear operations.

### Differential

Let $F: M^m \to N^n$ be a smooth map between manifolds $M$ and $N$. The **differential** of $F$ at a point $p \in M$, denoted as $dF_p: T_pM \to T_{F(p)}N$, is a linear map between tangent spaces induced by the pushforward of $F$.

It is defined as follows: for any tangent vector $X_p \in T_pM$ and any smooth function $f \in C^{\infty}_{F(p)}(N)$,
$$ dF_p(X_p)f = X_p(f \circ F) $$

**Local Coordinate Expression**: Let $(U, x)$ and $(V, y)$ be coordinate charts around $p$ and $F(p)$ respectively, and let $\tilde F = y \circ F \circ x^{-1}$ be the local representation of $F$. Then:
$$
\begin{align*}
dF_p(X_p) &= \sum_{j=1}^n X_p(y^j\circ F) \frac{\partial}{\partial y^j} \bigg|_{F(p)}\\
&= \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^m X_p^i \frac{\partial \tilde F^j}{\partial x^i} \bigg|_{x(p)} \frac{\partial}{\partial y^j} \bigg|_{F(p)}\\
&= \sum_{j=1}^n \left(\sum_{i=1}^m X_p^i \frac{\partial \tilde F^j}{\partial x^i} \bigg|_{x(p)}\right) \frac{\partial}{\partial y^j} \bigg|_{F(p)}
\end{align*}
$$

In matrix form, if $J_F(p) = \left(\frac{\partial \tilde F^j}{\partial x^i} \bigg|_{x(p)}\right)$ is the Jacobian matrix of $F$ at $p$, then:
$$ dF_p(X_p) = J_F(p) X_p $$
where $X_p$ is considered as a column vector in local coordinates.

### Vector Fields

A **vector field** on a manifold $M$ is a smooth section of the tangent bundle $TM$. That is, a vector field $X$ is a smooth map $X: M \to TM$ such that $\pi \circ X = \text{id}_M$, where $\pi: TM \to M$ is the bundle projection.

Equivalently, a vector field assigns to each point $p \in M$ a tangent vector $X_p \in T_pM$ in a smooth manner.

**Local Coordinate Expression**: 

The partial derivative operator $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$ can be viewed as a vector field on $M$ in the coordinate chart $(U, x)$, where it acts on smooth functions $f \in C^\infty(U)$ by:
$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} = d(x^i \circ f) = d(f \circ x^{-1}) \bigg|_{x(p)} $$

where $x^i$ is the $i$-th coordinate function in the chart $(U, x)$.

In a coordinate chart $(U, x = (x^1, \ldots, x^n))$, a vector field $X$ can be expressed as:
$$ X = \sum_{i=1}^n X^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} $$
where $X^i: U \to \mathbb{R}$ are smooth functions called the **components** of the vector field $X$ with respect to the coordinate chart $(U, x)$.

The smoothness of the vector field $X$ is equivalent to the smoothness of all its component functions $X^i$.

**Space of Vector Fields**: We denote by $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ or $\Gamma^{\infty}(TM)$ the space of all smooth vector fields on $M$. This space is both a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ and a module over the ring $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on $M$.


## Exterior Algebra, Differential Forms

**Note**: we discuss multilinear functions over $\mathbb{R}$-vector spaces, but the theory can be generalized to $\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces or other vector spaces over a field.

### Dual Space

Let $V,W$ be a $\mathbb{R}$-vector space, we denote all of the mapping from $V$ to $W$ as $\text{Hom}(V,W)$.

The **dual space** of $V$, denoted as $V^{\vee}$ or $V^*$, is the vector space of all linear maps from $V$ to $\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $V^* = \text{Hom}(V, \mathbb{R})$.

The elements of the dual space $V^*$ are called **covectors** or **dual vectors**.

The basis of the dual space $V^*$ is defined as the set of linear functionals that map each basis vector of $V$ to $\mathbb{R}$, while mapping all other basis vectors to zero.

To be specific, let $V$ be $n$-dimensional vector space, if $\{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n\}$ is a basis of $V$, then the dual basis $\{\alpha^1, \alpha^2, \ldots, \alpha^n\}$ of $V^*$ is defined by:
$$ \alpha^i(e_j) = \delta^i_j $$
where $\delta^i_j$ is the Kronecker delta.

To show that $\{\alpha^1, \alpha^2, \ldots, \alpha^n\}$ is a basis of $V^*$, we need to show that it is linearly independent and spans $V^*$.

Let $f \in V^*$ be a linear functional. We can express $f$ in terms of the dual basis as:
$$ f = \sum_{i=1}^n f(e_i) \alpha^i $$

where $f(e_i)$ are the coefficients of the linear functional $f$ in the dual basis. This shows that $\{\alpha^1, \alpha^2, \ldots, \alpha^n\}$ spans $V^*$.

If $\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \alpha^i = 0$ for some coefficients $c_i$, then for any basis vector $e_j \in V$, we have:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \alpha^i(e_j) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \delta^i_j = c_j = 0 $$
for all $j = 1, 2, \ldots, n$. This implies that all coefficients $c_i = 0$, showing that the dual basis is linearly independent.

### Multilinear function

Let $V^k$ be the $k$-fold Cartesian product of a vector space $V$, i.e., $V^k = \underbrace{V \times V \times \ldots \times V}_{k\text{ times}}$ . A **multilinear function** or **$k$-linear function** is a function $f: V^k \to \mathbb{R}$ that is linear in each argument separately. It is a type $(0,k)$ tensor.

One can prove that all multilinear functions on $V$ forms a vector space, denoted as $L_k(V)$ or $\text{Mult}(V^k; \mathbb{R})$.

#### Examples

1. **Dot Product**: For a $\mathbb{R}$-vector space $V$ with a standard basis $\{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n\}$, the dot product is a bilinear function $f: V^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ defined as:
   $$ f(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^n x^i y^i $$
   where $x = \sum_{i=1}^n x^i e_i$ and $y = \sum_{i=1}^n y^i e_i$ are vectors in $V$.

2. **Determinant**: The determinant is a multilinear function $f: V^n \to \mathbb{R}$ defined on the space of $n \times n$ matrices. It is linear in each row (or column) of the matrix.

Let $\sigma\in S_k$ be a permutation of the indices $\{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$. The left action of $\sigma$ on a multilinear function $f: V^k \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined as:
$$ \sigma f(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k) = f(v_{\sigma(1)}, v_{\sigma(2)}, \ldots, v_{\sigma(k)}) $$

A **symmetric multilinear function** is a multilinear function that is invariant under any permutation of its arguments. 

Formally, $\sigma f = f $ for any permutation $\sigma\in S_k$.

An **alternating multilinear function** is a multilinear function that changes sign when two of its arguments are swapped, or equivalently, changes by a factor of $sgn(\sigma)$ when permuted by $\sigma$.

Formally, $\sigma f = \text{sgn}(\sigma) f$ for any permutation $\sigma\in S_k$, where $\text{sgn}(\sigma)$ is the sign of the permutation.

All symmetric multilinear functions on $V$ forms a vector space, denoted as $S_k(V)$ or $\text{Sym}(V^k; \mathbb{R})$.
All alternating multilinear functions on $V$ forms a vector space, denoted as $A_k(V)$ or $\text{Alt}(V^k; \mathbb{R})$.


#### Symmetrizing and Alternating Operators

Let $V$ be a vector space and $f: V^k \to \mathbb{R}$ be a multilinear function. We can define the **symmetrizing operator** and **alternating operator** on $f$.

The **symmetrizing operator** $S: L_k(V) \to S_k(V)$ is defined as:
$$ S(f)(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k) = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_k} \sigma f $$

The symmetrizing operator takes a multilinear function and produces a symmetric multilinear function by averaging over all permutations of its arguments.

The **alternating operator** $A: L_k(V) \to A_k(V)$ is defined as:
$$ A(f)(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k) = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_k} \text{sgn}(\sigma) \sigma f $$   

The alternating operator takes a multilinear function and produces an alternating multilinear function by summing over all permutations of its arguments, weighted by the sign of the permutation.

We shall only prove the alternating operator does produce an alternating multilinear function. The proof for the symmetrizing operator is trivial.

**Proof**: Let $f$ be a multilinear function and $A(f)$ be the result of the alternating operator. For any permutation $\tau \in S_k$, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
\tau A(f) &= \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_k} \text{sgn}(\sigma) \tau \circ\sigma f \\
&= \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_k} \text{sgn}(\tau) \text{sgn}(\tau \circ \sigma) \tau \circ\sigma f \\
&= \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{\sigma' \in S_k} \text{sgn}(\sigma') \sigma' f \\
&= \text{sgn}(\tau) A(f)
\end{align*} 
$$

The alternating operator $A$ satisfies the following properties:
1. **Linearity**: For $f_1, f_2 \in L_k(V)$ and $r,s\in \mathbb{R}$, we have:
   $$ A(r f_1 + s f_2) = r A(f_1) + s A(f_2) $$
2. $A(f\otimes A(g)) = A(A(f)\otimes g) = A(f\otimes g)$
3. $A\circ A = A$ 

### Tensor Product

Let $f\in L_k(V)$ and $g\in L_l(V)$ be two multilinear functions on $V$. The **tensor product** of $f$ and $g$, denoted as $f \otimes g$, is a multilinear function on $V^{k+l}$ defined as:
$$ (f \otimes g)(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{k+l}) = f(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k) g(v_{k+1}, v_{k+2}, \ldots, v_{k+l}) $$

The tensor product satisfies associativity and bilinearity.
Formally, we have:
1. **Associativity**: $(f \otimes g) \otimes h = f \otimes (g \otimes h)$ for any multilinear function $h \in L_m(V)$.
2. **Bilinearity**: For $f,f_1,f_2 \in L_k(V)$ and $g,g_1,g_2 \in L_l(V)$; $r,s\in \mathbb R$, we have:
    $$ (r f_1 + s f_2) \otimes g = r (f_1 \otimes g) + s (f_2 \otimes g) $$
    $$ f \otimes (r g_1 + s g_2) = r (f \otimes g_1) + s (f \otimes g_2) $$

**Example**: Let $(e_1,\ldots,e_n)$ be a basis of $V$, $(\alpha^1,\ldots,\alpha^n)$ be the dual basis of $V^*$. Then the inner product is a bilinear function $f: V\times V \to \mathbb{R}$ defined as:
$$ \langle x,y\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n x^i y^i $$
where $x = \sum_{i=1}^n x^i e_i$ and $y = \sum_{i=1}^n y^i e_i$ are vectors in $V$.

Now, let $g_{ij}=\langle e_i,e_j\rangle$, $\langle x,y\rangle = \sum x^i y^j g_{ij} = \sum \alpha^i(x) \alpha^j(y) g_{ij} = \sum_{i,j} g_{ij} (\alpha^i \otimes \alpha^j)(x,y)$.

So we can write the inner product as a tensor product of the dual basis:
$$ \langle x,y\rangle = \sum_{i,j} g_{ij} (\alpha^i \otimes \alpha^j)(x,y) $$

### Wedge Product

The **wedge product** or **exterior product** is an operation on alternating multilinear functions that produces a new alternating multilinear function. It is denoted by $\wedge$ and is defined as follows:

For all $f \in A_k(V)$ and $g \in A_l(V)$, the wedge product $f \wedge g \in A_{k+l}(V)$ is defined by:
$$ (f \wedge g) = \binom{k+l}{k} A(f\otimes g)$$ 
or equivalently,
$$(f \wedge g)(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{k+l}) = \frac{1}{k!l!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_{k+l}} \text{sgn}(\sigma) f(v_{\sigma(1)}, v_{\sigma(2)}, \ldots, v_{\sigma(k)}) g(v_{\sigma(k+1)}, v_{\sigma(k+2)}, \ldots, v_{\sigma(k+l)}) $$

To avoid division by factorials, we can define the wedge product as sum over sorted permutations:
$$
\begin{equation*} 
(f \wedge g)(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{k+l}) =  \sum_{\substack{\sigma \in S_{k+l} \\ \sigma(1) < \sigma(2) < \ldots < \sigma(k) \\ \sigma(k+1) < \sigma(k+2) < \ldots < \sigma(k+l)}} \text{sgn}(\sigma) f(v_{\sigma(1)}, v_{\sigma(2)}, \ldots, v_{\sigma(k)}) g(v_{\sigma(k+1)}, v_{\sigma(k+2)}, \ldots, v_{\sigma(k+l)})
\end{equation*}
$$

Let $f \in A_k(V)$ and $g \in A_l(V)$ be alternating multilinear functions. The wedge product satisfies the following properties:
1. **Bilinearity**: It is bilinear on $f$ and $g$.
2. **Associativity**: It is associative, i.e., $(f \wedge g) \wedge h = f \wedge (g \wedge h)$ for any alternating multilinear function $h$.
3. **Anticommutativity**: It is anticommutative, i.e., $f \wedge g = (-1)^{kl} g \wedge f$. Particularly, $f \wedge f = 0$ when $k$ is odd.
4. $c\wedge f=cf$, $\forall c\in \mathbb R$.

Let $r\in N$, $f_i\in A_{k_i}(V)$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,r$, the wedge product $f_1 \wedge f_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge f_r$ is $\binom{k_1+\ldots+k_r}{k_1,\ldots,k_r} A(f_1\otimes f_2\otimes \ldots \otimes f_r)$, where $\binom{k_1+\ldots+k_r}{k_1,\ldots,k_r}$ is the multinomial coefficient. 

or equivalently,
$$ (f_1 \wedge f_2 \wedge \ldots \wedge f_r)(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{k_1+\ldots+k_r}) = \frac{1}{k_1!k_2!\ldots k_r!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_{k_1+\ldots+k_r}} \text{sgn}(\sigma) f_1(v_{\sigma(1)}, v_{\sigma(2)}, \ldots, v_{\sigma(k_1)}) f_2(v_{\sigma(k_1+1)}, v_{\sigma(k_1+2)}, \ldots, v_{\sigma(k_1+k_2)}) \ldots f_r(v_{\sigma(k_1+\ldots+k_{r-1}+1)}, v_{\sigma(k_1+\ldots+k_{r-1}+2)}, \ldots, v_{\sigma(k_1+\ldots+k_r)}) $$

This shows the associativity directly.

#### Relation to determinant

Let $\alpha^1,\ldots,\alpha^n\in V^*$, $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in V$, then:
$$ (\alpha^1 \wedge \alpha^2 \wedge \ldots \wedge \alpha^n)(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n) = \det[(\alpha^i(v_j))_{i,j}] $$

This is the determinant of the matrix formed by evaluating the dual basis vectors on the vectors $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$.

### Graded Algebra and Exterior Algebra

#### Graded Algebra

Let $\mathbb K$ be a field, the **graded algebra** $(A,\times)$ is a vector space $A$ over $\mathbb K$ equipped with a direct sum decomposition $A = \bigoplus_{k=0}^{\infty} A_k$, where each $A_k$ is a vector space of degree $k$. The multiplication operation $\times: A \times A \to A$ satisfies:
$$ \times: A_k \times A_l \to A_{k+l} $$

$(A,\times)$ is called **anticommutative** if for all $a \in A_k$ and $b \in A_l$, $ab = (-1)^{kl} ba$.

A homomorphism of graded algebra is an algebra homomorphism that preserves the degree.

#### Exterior Algebra

The **exterior algebra** or **Grassmann algebra** $(\bigwedge V, \wedge)$ is a **anticommutative graded algebra** defined on a vector space $V$ with the wedge product $\wedge$, where $\bigwedge V = \bigoplus_{k=0}^{\infty} A_k(V)$. When $V$ is finite-dimensional, we can write $\bigwedge V = \bigoplus_{k=0}^{\dim V} A_k(V)$ or $\bigwedge V = \bigoplus_{k=0}^{n} \bigwedge ^k V$, where $n = \dim V$. 

This is because $A_k(V) = 0$ for $k > \dim V$, which we shall prove later.

$\bigwedge^k V$ is called the **$k$-th exterior power** of $V$.

#### Basis of $L_k$

Let $I=(i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k)$ be a $k$-indices, $e_1,\ldots,e_n$ and $\alpha^1,\ldots,\alpha^n$ are the basis of the vector space $V$ and its dual $V^*$ respectively. Denote $(e_{i_1}, e_{i_2}, \ldots, e_{i_k})$ as $e_I$, and $\alpha^I = \alpha^{i_1} \wedge \alpha^{i_2} \wedge \ldots \wedge \alpha^{i_k}$. $\alpha^I(e_J) = \delta^I_J$, where $\delta^I_J$ is the generalized Kronecker delta, which is $1$ if $I=J$ and $0$ otherwise.

Let $I=(1 \leq i_1 < \cdots < i_k \leq n)$, we claim that $\{\alpha^I\}_{I}$ is a basis of $A_k(V)$.

The proof is similar to the proof in the dual space section.

Corollary 1: The dimension of $A_k(V)$ is $\binom{n}{k}$, where $n = \dim V$.

Corollary 2: The dimension of $\bigwedge V$ is $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n$, where $n = \dim V$.

Corollary 3: The dimension of $A_k(V)$ is $0$ for $k > \dim V$.

Proof: For $k > \dim V$, the set of indices $I=(i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k)$ cannot be chosen such that $1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k \leq n$, hence $A_k(V) = 0$.

### Inner Product

Let $V$ be a vector space, $v\in V$, and $\omega \in \bigwedge^k V$. The **inner product** of $v$ and $\omega$, denoted as $\iota_v \omega$, is a linear map $\iota_v: \bigwedge^k V \to \bigwedge^{k-1} V$ defined by:
$$ \iota_v(\omega) = \sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^{i-1} \alpha^i(v) \alpha^{1} \wedge \ldots \wedge \widehat{\alpha^i} \wedge \ldots \wedge \alpha^{k} $$

where $\widehat{\alpha^i}$ means that the $i$-th term is omitted from the wedge product.

The inner product $\iota_v$ is called the **interior product** or **contraction** with respect to the vector $v$. It reduces the degree of the form by 1.

Let $\alpha \in \bigwedge^k V, \beta \in \bigwedge^l V$, the inner product satisfies the following properties:
1. **Nilpotency**: $\iota_v \iota_v \alpha = 0$ for any $v \in V.
2.  $\iota_v(\alpha \wedge \beta) = \iota_v(\alpha) \wedge \beta + (-1)^k \alpha \wedge \iota_v(\beta)$.
3. **Linearity**: $\iota_{av + bw}(\alpha) = a \iota_v(\alpha) + b \iota_w(\alpha)$ for any $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $v,w \in V$.

### Pullback 

Let $L: W \to V$ be a linear map between vector spaces $W$ and $V$. The **pullback** of exterior forms under $L$, denoted as $L^*: \bigwedge^k V \to \bigwedge^k W$, is defined by:
$$ L^*(\omega)(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_k) = \omega(L(w_1), L(w_2), \ldots, L(w_k)) $$
for all $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_k \in W^*$.

The pullback satisfies the following properties:
1. $L^*(\alpha \wedge \beta) = L^*(\alpha) \wedge L^*(\beta)$ 
2. $\iota_w(L^*(\alpha)) = L^*(\iota_{L(w)}(\alpha))$.

### Differential Forms 

We have defined the exterior algebra $\bigwedge V$ and the wedge product $\wedge$ on an abstract vector space $V$. Now we can define **differential forms** on a manifold $M$, where $V$ is the tangent space $T_pM$ at a point $p \in M$.

#### Cotangent Space and Cotangent Bundle

The **cotangent space** $T^*_pM$ at a point $p \in M$ is the dual space of the tangent space $T_pM$. It consists of all linear functionals on $T_pM$. Elements of the cotangent space are called **covectors** or **differential 1-forms**.

The cotangent space $T^*_pM$ is a vector space of dimension $n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the manifold $M$.

The **cotangent bundle** $T^*M$ is the disjoint union of all cotangent spaces at each point in $M$:
$$ T^*M = \bigcup_{p \in M} T^*_pM = \{(p, \omega_p) : p \in M, \omega_p \in T^*_pM\} $$

The cotangent bundle $T^*M$ is a manifold of dimension $2n$.

Local coordinates on the cotangent bundle can be defined as $(x^1, x^2, \ldots, x^n, \omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots, \omega_n)$, where $(x^1, x^2, \ldots, x^n)$ are local coordinates on $M$ and $(\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots, \omega_n)$ are the components of a covector in the cotangent space with respect to the dual basis $\{dx^1, dx^2, \ldots, dx^n\}$.

#### Differential $k$-Forms

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n$. A **differential $k$-form** on $M$ is a smooth section of the $k$-th exterior power of the cotangent bundle, denoted as $\bigwedge^k T^*M$.

In other words, a differential $k$-form on a open subset $U \subseteq M$ is a mapping $$ \omega: U \to \bigwedge^k T^*M $$ that assigns to each point $p \in U$ an alternating multilinear function $\omega(p): T_pM^k \to \mathbb{R}$ and $\omega \in A_k(T_pM)$ for all $p \in U$.

Let $\{e_1 = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}\right|_p, e_2 = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^2}\right|_p, \ldots, e_n = \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\right|_p\}$ be a basis of $T_pM$. The corresponding dual basis of $T^*_pM$ is $\{dx^1, dx^2, \ldots, dx^n\}$, where $dx^i(e_j) = \delta^i_j$. 

A basis of $A_k(T_pM)$ is then given by $\{dx^I\}_{I}$, where $I = (i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k)$ is a $k$-tuple of indices with $1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k \leq n$, and $dx^I$ denotes the wedge product $dx^{i_1} \wedge dx^{i_2} \wedge \ldots \wedge dx^{i_k}$. 

Therefore, a differential $k$-form $\omega$ can be expressed in local coordinates as:
$$ \omega = \sum_{I} f_I dx^I $$
where $f_I: U \to \mathbb{R}$ are functions on $U$.

A differential $k$-form $\omega$ is called **smooth** if all the functions $f_I$ are smooth functions on $U$.

Let $\Omega^k(M)=\Gamma^{\infty}(\bigwedge^k T^*M)$ be the space of all smooth differential $k$-forms on a manifold $M$. It is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$.

The wedge product of two differential forms $\omega_1 \in \Omega^k(M)$ and $\omega_2 \in \Omega^l(M)$ is pointwise defined as:
$$ (\omega_1 \wedge \omega_2)(p) = \omega_1(p) \wedge \omega_2(p) = \sum_{I,J} f_I(p) g_J(p) dx^I \wedge dx^J $$
where $f_I$ and $g_J$ are the coefficients of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ in local coordinates, respectively. Note that if $I$ and $J$ are such that $I \cap J \neq \emptyset$, then $dx^I \wedge dx^J = 0$ due to the anticommutativity of the wedge product.
The wedge product of differential forms is bilinear and associative, and it satisfies the anticommutativity property:
$$ \omega_1 \wedge \omega_2 = (-1)^{kl} \omega_2 \wedge \omega_1 $$

Let $\Omega^*(M) = \bigoplus_{k=0}^n \Omega^k(M)$ be the space of all smooth differential forms on $M$. It is a graded algebra with respect to the wedge product $\wedge$.

#### Coordinate Functions and Their Differentials

Let $(U, x) = (U, x^1, \ldots, x^n)$ be a coordinate chart on a smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $n$. The coordinate functions $x^i: U \to \mathbb{R}$ are smooth functions that assign to each point $p \in U$ its $i$-th coordinate $x^i(p)$. 

The **coordinate 1-forms** $dx^i$ are smooth sections of the cotangent bundle, each $dx^i: U \to T^*M$ satisfies $$\pi \circ dx^i = \text{id}_U$$
where $\pi: T^*M \to M$ is the bundle projection. 

We have $dx^i|_p: T_pM \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $dx^i|_p(v) = v(x^i(p))$ for any tangent vector $v \in T_pM$. The coordinate 1-forms satisfy the dual basis property: $$\left.dx^i\right|_p\left(\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right|_p\right) = \delta^i_j$$
making $\{dx^1|_p, \ldots, dx^n|_p\}$ the dual basis of $T_p^*M$ corresponding to the coordinate basis $\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}|_p, \ldots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}|_p\}$ of $T_pM$. 

Any differential $k$-form on $U$ can be uniquely expressed as $\omega = \sum_{|I|=k} f_I \, dx^I$, where $I = (i_1, \ldots, i_k)$ with $1 \leq i_1 < \cdots < i_k \leq n$, $dx^I = dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k}$, and $f_I: U \to \mathbb{R}$ are smooth functions.

### Pullback of Differential Forms

Let $F: M \to N$ be a smooth map between manifolds, and let $\omega \in \Omega^k(N)$ be a differential $k$-form on $N$. The **pullback** of $\omega$ by $F$, denoted as $F^*\omega$, is a differential $k$-form on $M$ defined by:
$$ (F^*\omega)(p)(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k) = \omega(F(p))(dF_p(v_1), dF_p(v_2), \ldots, dF_p(v_k)) $$
where $dF_p: T_pM \to T_{F(p)}N$ is the differential of $F$ at the point $p$.

#### Local Coordinate Expression

Let $(U, x^1, \ldots, x^m)$ and $(V, y^1, \ldots, y^n)$ be coordinate charts on $M$ and $N$ respectively, with $F(U) \subseteq V$. 

Let $F: M \to N$ have local coordinate representation $F^i = y^i \circ F \circ x^{-1}$, where $(x^1, \ldots, x^m)$ are coordinates on $M$ and $(y^1, \ldots, y^n)$ are coordinates on $N$.

If $\omega$ has the local expression:
$$ \omega = \sum_{|I|=k} f_I \, dy^I $$
where $f_I: V \to \mathbb{R}$ are smooth functions.

Then the pullback $F^*\omega$ has the expression:
$$ 
\begin{align*}
F^*\omega &= \sum_{|I|=k} (f_I \circ F) \, F^*(dy^I) \\
&= \sum_{|I|=k} (f_I \circ F) \, d(y^{i_1} \circ F) \wedge \cdots \wedge d(y^{i_k} \circ F) 
\end{align*}
$$

Note:
$$ d(y^{i_j} \circ F) = d(F^{i_j} \circ x) = \sum_{l=1}^m \frac{\partial F^{i_j}}{\partial x^l} dx^l $$

Therefore:
$$ F^*\omega = \sum_{|I|=k} (f_I \circ F) \, \left(\sum_{l_1=1}^m \frac{\partial F^{i_1}}{\partial x^{l_1}} dx^{l_1}\right) \wedge \cdots \wedge \left(\sum_{l_k=1}^m \frac{\partial F^{i_k}}{\partial x^{l_k}} dx^{l_k}\right) $$

#### Properties of Pullback

The pullback operation satisfies the following important properties:

1. **Linearity**: $F^*(a\omega_1 + b\omega_2) = aF^*\omega_1 + bF^*\omega_2$ for $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$

2. **Preservation of wedge product**: 
   $$ F^*(\omega_1 \wedge \omega_2) = F^*\omega_1 \wedge F^*\omega_2 $$

3. **Functoriality**: If $G: L \to M$ and $F: M \to N$ are smooth maps, then:
   $$ (F \circ G)^* = G^* \circ F^* $$

4. **Identity**: $(\text{id}_M)^* = \text{id}_{\Omega^*(M)}$

### Exterior Derivative

The **Exterior Derivative** is an operator $d: \Omega^k(M) \to \Omega^{k+1}(M)$ that generalizes the concept of differentiation to differential forms. It is defined as follows:
$$
d\omega = \sum_{|I|=k} \left( \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial x^j} \right) dx^j \wedge dx^I
$$
where $\omega = \sum_{|I|=k} f_I \, dx^I$ is a differential $k$-form on $M$, and $dx^I = dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k}$ for $I = (i_1, \ldots, i_k)$.

It can be naturally extended to the exterior algebra $\bigwedge^*(M)$ as follows:
$$ d(\omega) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} d\omega_k $$

where $\omega = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \omega_k$ and $\omega_k \in \Omega^k(M)$.

The exterior derivative satisfies the following properties:
1. **Linearity**: $d(a\omega_1 + b\omega_2) = a d\omega_1 + b d\omega_2$ for $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$.
2. **Nilpotency**: $d^2 = 0$, i.e., $d(d\omega) = 0$ for any differential form $\omega$.
3. **Antiderivation Property**: $d(\omega_1 \wedge \omega_2) = d\omega_1 \wedge \omega_2 + (-1)^k \omega_1 \wedge d\omega_2$ for $\omega_1 \in \Omega^k(M)$ and $\omega_2 \in \Omega^l(M)$.
4. **Pullback Compatibility**: For any smooth map $F: M \to N$, we have:
   $$ F^*(d\omega) = d(F^*\omega) $$
5. **Vanishing of Top Forms**: $d\omega = 0$ if $\omega\in \Omega^n(M)$, where $n = \dim M$.
